  summary: "Constructor for instantiating a iot hsm object.  This is an object that\n\
    communicates with the Azure IoT Edge HSM in order to get connection credentials\n\
    for an Azure IoT Edge module.  The credentials that this object return come in\n\
    two forms:\n\n1. The trust bundle, which is a certificate that can be used as\
    \ a trusted cert to authenticate the SSL connection between the IoE Edge module\
    \ and IoT Edge \n\n2. A signing function, which can be used to create the sig\
    \ field for a SharedAccessSignature string which can be used to authenticate with\
    \ Iot Edge \n\nInstantiating this object does not require any parameters.  All\
    \ necessary parameters\ncome from environment variables that are set inside the\
    \ IoT Edge module container\nby the edgeAgent that creates the module."
